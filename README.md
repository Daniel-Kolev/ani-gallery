# ani-gallery

A university project I am rebuilding ([Legacy site](https://ani.gallery/)) for my girlfriend where she can showcase her art. Apart from making her happy, I will see what [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) can teach me.
